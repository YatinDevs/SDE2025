# History Of JavaScript

## What are these ?

- ECMAScript.
- JavaScript.
- ES5
- ES6
- ES7
- ES2015
- ES2016
- ES2017
- ES2018

## 1995 NetScape Navigator

- Most Popular Web Browser in 1995.
- Netscape Navigator was a web browser created in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation.
- It is the first commercially successful web browser with a graphical user interface that renders images in line with the text.
- The browser was free and usable for non-commercial purposes.

<!-- NetScape Navigator - Brendan Eich Created  -->

## Need For New Programming Language to add Interactivity?

- Brendan Eich - at time was working for NetScape Navigator
- Within 10 Day Created -> JavaScript Which was named Mocha at that time.
- Netscape Navigator was the first browser to support JavaScript, which was initially called Mocha.
- The Language Called Mocha Was then Build to make the Website Interactive.
- This Language was Named as Mocha.
- Mocha was later renamed to LiveScript.
- LiveScript was later renamed to JavaScript.

<!-- JavaScript launched in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, who used to work at Netscape. Initially, it wasn't called JavaScript; it was given the name Mocha -->

<!-- The name Mocha was chosen by Marc Andreessen, a Netscape founder.-->

<!-- Brendan Eich is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. -->

<!-- Mocha was later renamed to Livescript, and finally it became known as Javascript, Named after popular Language at that time Java. -->

## At Same Time Frame Looking At the Hype of Java Script

- Internet Explorer Created ----> JScript. --> looking at Hype.
- 1996
- They Named it JScript looking at Java name hype.

- European Computer Manufacturers Association.
- ECMA Standardization - for difference in JavaScript and Jscript
- JavaScript was better for NetScape Navigator.
- JScript was better for Internet Explorer.
- So ECMA Decides Standardization for Both Languages.
- ECMA-262 - Standardization of JavaScript and JScript.

- ES1 : 1997 - First Specification
- ES5 : (Lot of New Features.) - 2009.
- ES6 : (Biggest Update in History of JS.) - 2015.

- Members of Technical Community 39. (tc39).
- Decides New Features and Updates in ECMAScript.

- Checks:

  - Allow input into specification
  - Identify Potential Challenges /Shape of Solution
  - Precisely Describe the Syntax and Semantics using formal spec language.
  - Indicate that further refinement will require feedback from implementations and users.
  - Indicate that the addition is ready for inclusion in the Formal EcmaScript Standard.

- ES6 : ES2015
- ES7 : ES2016
- ES8 : ES2017

- JavaScript is Backward compatible.
- New Features are added on top of existing features.

<!-- What is backward compatible language?
Backward compatibility refers to hardware or software that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems. For example, Perl, the scripting language, was designed to be backward compatible with awk, an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace.-->

- JavaScript is not Forward compatible.
